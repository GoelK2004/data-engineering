Configure Self-hosted Integration Runtime to Extract Data from Local Server and Load into Azure SQL Database:
	Set up a Self-hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) in Azure Data Factory to securely connect to an on-premises server.
	Extract data from the local environment and load it into an Azure SQL Database to enable cloud-based analytics and processing.
Configure FTP/SFTP Server and Create an ADF Pipeline for Data Extraction:
	Set up access to FTP/SFTP servers and build a pipeline in Azure Data Factory to extract files or datasets from these sources.
	This facilitates integration with external systems or partners.
Create Incremental Load Pipeline and Automate This on a Daily Basis:
	Design an ADF pipeline to perform incremental data loads using techniques like watermarking or change tracking.
	Schedule this pipeline to run daily to ensure only new or modified records are processed, optimizing performance and reducing load.
Automate a Pipeline to Trigger Every Last Saturday of the Month:
	Configure a custom time-based trigger in Azure Data Factory to run the pipeline on the last Saturday of each month.
	This supports periodic reporting and batch processing without manual intervention.
Retrieving data. Wait a few seconds and try to cut or copy again:
	Implement logic to handle data retrieval failures gracefully by waiting briefly (e.g., a few seconds) 
	before retrying cut, copy, or extraction operations, improving pipeline resilience and reducing transient error impacts.
